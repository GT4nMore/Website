<h2>A brief explaination of CS-GO</h2>
<p class="backgroundoftext">
  Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve. It is extremly difficult, considering you have to wrangle teamates, manage your economy, predict your enemies economy, buy the correct stuff, then aim for the head and spray correctly. Then there is a bunch of extra stuff like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever.<br>

  Its not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse. There is a story that someone was so good with his mouse, be became the mouse. The mouse permanently fused into his hand. Now he has to use his other hands for certains things...<br>
<br>
  The game has multiple <a href="Content.html">maps</a>, including Dust II which is the only map. And Mirage, but Mirage just really isn't working these days.<br>

  The game will bring you so many fun experiences! Like playing a game with Aldon Hitler as he only buys a negev and unpolitely refuses to buy anything else as we lose 16-14 against 4 bots - this game is fun. In the words of a certain person: "this is gameplay"<br>
<br>
  You can play as the terrorists and blow stuff up while praising the one god; or you can play as the Counter - Terrorists, who counter the Terrorist terrorizing terrorism.<br>
<br>
  Some of the <a href="Guns.html">guns</a> are: the Deagle, the AK - 47, the P90, the AWP and most important and the deadliest of all: the Decoy Grenade. Not many people know that every Decoy grenade is sent from the deepst circle of Hell where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all enternity.<br>
<br>
  On your journey to become better on this game, you will encounter smurfs, non - bilingual Russians, toxicity, mute people, people that will make you realize that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation or at least will make you consider that being true. But the worst of all: people who type "Nice try" after you fail your clutch attempt.<br>
<br>
  There are a lot of mods for the game: like Bunny Hopping servers, 1v1 servers, Surfing servers, Jailbreak, and a lot of other stuff. I almost forgot to mention the skins: every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money. Every skin is different and has a different price ranging from your generic pistol skin to a 1600$ knife skin.<br>
<br>
  It's a great game that is also perfectly free - so go get it!
